This is mostly a training project for me.
It aims at providing a webapp to manage the meeting room reservations in a coworking space.

It has two main parts:

- backend is in `back` repository and provides an API to access and create data.
  It is built on top of Python/Django/DjangoRestFramework.
- frontend is in `front` repository and provides a UI which allows to manage data via the backend API.
  It is build with react and (too) many Javascript modules.
  
More doc will be available when the project will grow. Maybe...
